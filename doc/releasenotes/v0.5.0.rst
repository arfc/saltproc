Summary
=======

.. 
  Describe generally the features of this release


This release adds support for ``OpenMC`` in ``SaltProc`` via the addition of
the ``DepcodeOpenMC`` class



Dependency Changes
==================

..
  Describe any new/removed/modified package dependencies


- ``SaltProc`` now optionally requires the following package:

  - (new) → `openmc`_
  
- ``pyne>=0.5.11`` → ``pyne>=0.5.11=nomoab_noopenmc*``
  


New Features
============

..
  Describe any new features to the code.

- ``openmc`` support via `DepcodeOpenMC`



Bug Fixes
=========

..
  Describe any bug fixes.




Script Changes
==============

..
  Describe any script additions/modifications/removals



- Added convenience features to ``process_j312.bash``

  - Control flow check for an ``XSDIR`` environment variable set by the user. This variable should point to the location where the user would like the library to be installed
  - Commands to download and run the ``xsdirconvert.pl`` script (found on the Serpent wiki) to convert the MCNP ``.dir`` style file to the Serpent ``.xsdata`` style file
  - Add ``SERPENT_DATA`` and ``SERPENT_ACELIB`` variables to ``.bashrc``

- A new script, ``scripts/ci/openmc-xs.bash``, that downloads the OpenMC HDF5 cross section library.



Python API Changes
==================

..
  Describe any changes to the API

- The test suite has been overhauled and moved to the `tests/` directory. The test suite is no longer part of the `saltproc` package.

- Input file format changes:

  - ``depcode['template_inputfile_path']`` → ``depcode['template_input_file_path']``
  - The ``depcode['template_input_file_path']`` input variable now has the following depletion-code-depentent types:
    
    - ``str`` for ``Serpent2``
    - ``dict`` of ``str`` to ``str`` for ``openmc``

  - ``depcode['iter_inputfile']`` → (removed)
  - ``depcode['iter_matfile']`` → (removed)

.. note:: While the ``iter_inputfile`` and ``iter_matfile`` variables have been removed from the saltproc input file,
   they remain part of the ``DepcodeSerpent`` class as attributes. Their use is unchanged, save for the fact they can no
   longer be initialized by the user during object creation.


- New/changed classes, methods, and attributes:

  - ``Depcode``

    - ``template_inputfile_path`` → ``template_input_file_path``
    - Changed `iter_inputfile` and `iter_matfile` to be attributes instead of parameters
    - ``read_depcode_info()`` → ``read_step_metadata()``
    - ``sim_info`` → ``step_metadata``
    - ``read_depcode_step_param()`` → ``read_neutronics_parameters()``
    - ``param`` → ``neutronics_parameters``
    - ``read_dep_comp()`` → ``read_depleted_materials()``
    - ``run_depcode()`` → ``run_depletion_step()``

  - ``DepcodeSerpent`` → ``SerpentDepcode``

    - ``template_inputfile_path`` → ``template_input_file_path``
    - Changed `iter_inputfile` and `iter_matfile` to be attributes instead of parameters
    - ``read_depcode_info()`` → ``read_depletion_step_metadata()``
    - ``sim_info`` → ``step_metadata``
    - ``read_depcode_step_param()`` → ``read_neutronics_parameters()``
    - ``param`` → ``neutronics_parameters``
    - ``read_dep_comp()`` → ``read_depleted_materials()``
    - ``create_nuclide_name_map_zam_to_serpent()`` → ``map_nuclide_code_zam_to_serpent()``
    - ``run_depcode()`` → ``run_depletion_step()``

  - ``OpenMCDepcode`` is a ``Depcode`` subclass that interfaces with ``openmc``. This class implements the following functions 
    - ``run_depcode()``
    - ``switch_to_next_geometry()``
    - ``write_depcode_input()``
    - ``write_depletion_settings()``
    - ``write_saltproc_openmc_tallies()``

  - ``app.py``

    - ``reprocessing()`` → ``reprocess_materials()``
    - ``refill()`` → ``refill_materials()``
    - ``read_feeds_from_input`` → ``get_feeds()``
    - ``read_processes_from_input`` → ``get_extraction_processes()``
    - ``read_dot()`` → ``get_extraction_process_paths()``

  - ``Process``

    - ``calc_rem_efficiency()`` → ``calculate_removal_efficiency``

  - ``Sparger``

    - ``calc_rem_efficiency()`` → ``calculate_removal_efficiency``

  - ``Separator``

    - ``calc_rem_efficiency()`` → ``calculate_removal_efficiency``
