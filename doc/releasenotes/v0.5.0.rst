Script Changes
==============

..
  Describe any script additions/modifications/removals



- Added convenience features to ``process_j312.bash``

  - Control flow check for an ``XSDIR`` environment variable set by the user. This variable should point to the location where the user would like the library to be installed
  - Commands to download and run the ``xsdirconvert.pl`` script (found on the Serpent wiki) to convert the MCNP ``.dir`` style file to the Serpent ``.xsdata`` style file
  - Add ``SERPENT_DATA`` and ``SERPENT_ACELIB`` variables to ``.bashrc``

- A new script, ``scripts/ci/openmc-xs.bash``, that downloads the OpenMC HDF5 cross section library.



Python API Changes
==================

..
  Describe any changes to the API


- Input file format changes:

  - ``depcode['template_inputfile_path']`` → ``depcode['template_input_file_path']``
  - The ``depcode['template_input_file_path']`` input variable now has the following depletion-code-depentent types:
    
    - ``str`` for ``Serpent2``
    - ``dict`` of ``str`` to ``str`` for ``openmc``

  - ``depcode['iter_inputfile']`` → (removed)
  - ``depcode['iter_matfile']`` → (removed)

.. note:: While the ``iter_inputfile`` and ``iter_matfile`` variables have been removed from the saltproc input file,
   they remain part of the ``DepcodeSerpent`` class as attributes. Their use is unchanged, save for the fact they can no
   longer be initialized by the user during object creation.


- New/changed classes and methods:

  - ``Depcode``

    - ``template_inputfile_path`` → ``template_input_file_path``
    - Changed `iter_inputfile` and `iter_matfile` to be attributes instead of parameters

  - ``DepcodeSerpent``

    - ``template_inputfile_path`` → ``template_input_file_path``
    - Changed `iter_inputfile` and `iter_matfile` to be attributes instead of parameters


  - ``DepcodeOpenmc`` is a ``Depcode`` subclass that interfaces with ``openmc``. This class implements the following functions 

    - ``run_depcode()``
    - ``switch_to_next_geometry()``
    - ``write_depcode_input()``
    - ``write_depletion_settings()``
    - ``write_saltproc_openmc_tallies()``
