This release of SaltProc adds several new features, including a refactor of ``depcode``, updated documentation, and installation guides. Make sure you apply `this bug fix <https://ttuki.vtt.fi/serpent/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=3682&start=20#p12675>`__ in your Serpent2 code if you haven't already.

New Features
============

-  Complete refactor of the code into object-oriented python.
-  Adds a Sparging system package -- contained in the ``sparger`` and ``separator`` modules -- that calculates removal efficiencies for various target isotopes (i.e. Xe, Kr, H).
-  Adds a script for creating a Serpent2 compatible cross section library
-  Refactors the ``depcode`` module by making ``Depcode`` a purley abstract class; add the ``DepcodeSerpent`` class which is an instance of ``Depcode``
