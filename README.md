## SaltProc

![Build Status](https://github.com/arfc/saltproc/actions/workflows/test-saltproc.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

The SaltProc is a fuel reprocessing simulation tool for liquid fueled nuclear
reactors.

How to run SaltProc:

cd /path/to/saltproc
python saltproc -n 4 -d 1 -i examples/tap/tap_main.json
```
-n          number of cluster nodes to use in Serpent
-d          number of threads to use in Serpent
-i          path and name of SaltProc main input file
```

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the
[User's Guide](https://arfc.github.io/saltproc/installation.html).

### Documentation

The documentation for SaltProc can be found at
[arfc.github.io/saltproc/](http://arfc.github.io/saltproc/).
The entire contents of that
website can be built from the `doc` directory in the repositiory using the following steps with the [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) tool:

1. `conda env create -f doc/doc-environment.yml`
2. `cd doc/`
3. `make clean`
4. `make html`

After these steps, the website will be found in `saltproc/doc/_build/html`.

_Note_: We recommend using [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) CLI tool to install packages quickly. SaltProc has a compltex package dependency structure which can result is long environment solve times in the default ``conda`` solver. ``mamba`` is a reimplementation of ``conda`` in ``C++`` and we have found it is significantly faster.
