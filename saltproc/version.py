SaltProc
========
SaltProc is an on-line reprocessing driver for monte-carlo
particle transport codes with depletion capabilites. SaltProc
runs the monte-carlo simulation from a given input file and
parameters, then performs user-defined processing of the fuel
salt by adding or removing waste, fissile, and fertile streams.
